# Project 2_1: Mills Game ðŸŽ®

This project implements the classic board game Nine Men's Morris (also known as Mills). 

**Features:**

* **Two-player mode:**  Play against a friend on the same computer.
* **AI opponent (future):**  Challenge an AI agent with varying difficulty levels (coming soon!).

**System Requirements**
The implementation does not feature any performance intensive tasks, therefore it should run on any system, however, it should be noted that a [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) needs to be installed.

2. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone https://github.com/Tiimeeeyy/Project_2_1
3. **Navigate to the cloned Folder:** Either navigate to the folder using your preferred shell, or open it in your preferred code editor.
