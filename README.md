# Project 2_1 in Maastricht university 🫰.
## What is it ❓
This project aims to implement a game (Tak or Mills) 😲. The game(s) can be played by two players and Agents acting independently 😄. Where the agent play will be a future implementation 😿.
## How to use ❓:
Make sure maven is installed (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and added to the PATH 😜.
It is generally recommended to "clean" the maven project by runnning `mvn clean`. After that, you have two choices to run the game 👍:
1. Locate the `Main.java` file situated in the `src/main` package and run it
2. If that leads to any errors, use `mvn javafx:run`
## Game Rules
For the official game rules please refer to the official wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men's_morris#Rules).

## Most importantly: Have fun playing! 😄
